Docker
======

RosettaMPNN is set up to run in the same way as LigandMPNN, even though it can perform the functions of both ProteinMPNN and LigandMPNN.

The Docker image for RosettaMPNN is coming soon, in the mean time we have created Docker images for `ProteinMPNN <https://github.com/dauparas/ProteinMPNN>`_ and `LigandMPNN <https://github.com/dauparas/LigandMPNN>`_:
